## Assignment Challenges
---

Query part of the work was challenging, I work on SQL Async and passing two arguments were challenging parts of this assignment.


    ```javascript
    return Promise.all([
            conn.query('SELECT id, title FROM role ORDER BY title ASC'), 
            conn.query("SELECT employee.id, concat(employee.first_name, ' ' ,  employee.last_name) AS Employee FROM employee ORDER BY Employee ASC")
        ]);
    }).then(([roles, managers]) => {
